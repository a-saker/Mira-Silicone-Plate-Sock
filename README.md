## Universal Silicone Keyboard Gasket

### Preface
The initial commit of the Universal Silicone Keyboard Gasket was a keyboard gasket sock that was originally used in the Mira keyboard designed by Saker. With the primary goal to design something easily implemented in future keyboard designs and be used by others openly without many restrictions. 

With USKG-2, the design was changed to be easier to implement in other keyboard designs and while also being easier to use by individuals building keyboards with them.

### Use USKG with your own keyboard
The files for the gasket are located in the [production](./production/) directory.

The ideal mounting tabs for USKG-2 should be **16.00(w) x 1.50mm(h)**. Mounting tab height of 1.60mm (standard PCB) will work as well. The mounting tab **depth needs to be at least 4.00mm** for the plate sock to be seated completely. USKG-2 has internal bumps to slot onto the mounting tab. Slots on the side of the mounting tabs should have a Ã˜2.00mm and center aligned 2.45mm from the edge of the mounting tab. Reference the example implementation in [examples](./examples/) directory.

The minimum area around the plate socks (bounding box) should be at least 20.00(w) x 4.90(h) x 5.50mm(d). Using these exact numbers for the mounting location cutouts will result in a very tight fit. If you would like the gasket to aid as a force break between the top and bottom case, consider reducing the height of the cutout to below 4.90mm.

### Roadmap
* [X] Finalize naming to be easier to reference
* [X] Finalize technical drawings for reference for manufactures and implementation for designers
* [ ] Add reference images of prototypes/production in readme
* [ ] Manufacturer details that have the production molds
* [ ] License?
* [X] Update production files to version 2 of USKG
